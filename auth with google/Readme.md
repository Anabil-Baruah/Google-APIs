# Auth with google

Authenticating users is a crucial aspect of web application development, and one popular way to do it is by allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts. This not only simplifies the sign-in process for users but also eliminates the need for developers to manage their own user authentication systems. In this README, we'll explore how to authenticate users using Google's APIs and the benefits of doing so.




## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`CLIENT_ID`

`CLIENT_SECRET`


Also remember in order to have these informations you have to have a account in google cloud. Then you can avail these APIs for free. 
## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  cd google-APIs
```
```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm start
```

Note: These APIs are in raw format just so that you are only able to user them as a part of your code.
## Features

- Single sign-on (SSO): Google's authentication system enables SSO, meaning users can sign in to multiple applications and services with the same Google account credentials. This provides a seamless user experience and eliminates the need for users to remember multiple usernames and passwords.
- Third-party integration: Google's authentication system can be easily integrated with third-party services and applications using Google's APIs. This enables your application to securely access user data from other services, such as Gmail or Google Drive, and provides a streamlined experience for users.
- Secure and reliable: Google's authentication system uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which is a widely adopted industry-standard for secure authentication. Google's APIs are highly reliable and can handle large amounts of traffic, ensuring that your application's authentication system remains stable and available.
- Integration with other Google services: Google's authentication system integrates seamlessly with other Google services, such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Maps. This allows you to leverage these services and their APIs in your application while ensuring secure authentication.



## How to use

- Create a project on the Google Developers Console: To get started with Google's authentication system, you'll need to create a project on the Google Developers Console. This will provide you with access to the APIs and other tools you need to integrate Google authentication into your application.

- Obtain a client ID and secret key: Once you've created a project on the Google Developers Console, you'll need to obtain a client ID and secret key. These credentials are used to authenticate your application with Google's APIs and enable your application to access user data securely.

- Integrate Google's APIs into your application: With your client ID and secret key in hand, you can integrate Google's APIs into your application. This typically involves setting up the necessary API endpoints and configuring the authentication process to use Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol.

- Configure your application's authentication settings: Once you've integrated Google's APIs into your application, you'll need to configure your application's authentication settings. This typically involves setting up your application's callback URL, specifying the required scopes, and customizing the authentication UI to match your application's branding.

- Test your authentication system: With your authentication system set up and configured, it's important to test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. This involves testing the sign-in process, testing error handling and validation, and testing the integration with other Google services or third-party applications.

## Authentication
To authenticate your application, you will need to use the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The easiest way to authenticate is to use the Google API client libraries, which provide a simple and consistent interface for authenticating with Google APIs.
